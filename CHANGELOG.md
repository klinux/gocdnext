## v0.3.0 — 2026-04-30

Big release. Real-cluster smoke surfaced enough rough edges that
"helm install on a fresh cluster" now Just Works, end to end, with
no manual port-forwards, SQL inserts, or kubectl annotates. Plus a
substantial product layer: API tokens, service accounts, layer
cache, and observability landed in this cycle.

### Highlights

- **Observability** — Prometheus `/metrics` (8 series + Go runtime),
  `/readyz` with DB ping, OpenAPI 3.1 spec served at
  `/api/v1/openapi.yaml` and embedded in the binary.
- **API tokens + service accounts** — per-user tokens minted at
  `/account`, machine identities under `/admin/service-accounts`,
  Helm chart wires them through.
- **Runner profile env + encrypted secrets** — admins ship runtime
  config + AES-GCM-sealed credentials on the profile, every job
  inherits without per-pipeline plumbing. Buildx plugin gains
  `cache: registry|inline|bucket` for one-line layer caching.
- **`{{secret:NAME}}` references to global secrets** — profile
  secret values can reference globals; rotate once, propagate
  everywhere.
- **Default profile shipped via Helm** — `runnerProfiles: [default]`
  is now the chart default; pipelines reference `agent.profile:
  default` without operator pre-config.
- **Agent → StatefulSet + auto-register** — pod names are stable
  (`agent-0`), workspace is per-replica RWO, and the server
  auto-creates the DB row on first contact when the bearer token
  matches the configured registration secret. `replicas: N` Just
  Works.
- **Single-host unified routing** — one Ingress (or HTTPRoute) per
  host, server-side prefixes (`/api`, `/auth`, `/healthz`,
  `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/version`, `/artifacts`) on the same
  hostname as the web UI. Same-origin → no CORS, OIDC and signed
  URLs work.
- **Migrations on boot** — server runs `goose up` at startup;
  no separate migration job needed.
- **EntityChip cross-surface UX** — typed pill component with
  per-entity colour + icon used on pipeline card, run banner,
  audit log target column.

### Breaking changes (chart)

- `server.ingress.*`, `web.ingress.*`, `server.gateway.*`,
  `web.gateway.*` removed. Use top-level `ingress` / `gateway`
  with `exposeServer` / `exposeWeb` toggles instead.
- Agent moved from Deployment to StatefulSet — upgraders need to
  delete the old Deployment + PVC manually before installing
  v0.3.0 (the StatefulSet's `volumeClaimTemplates` won't bind
  to the legacy shared PVC).
- `agent.workspace.accessMode` default flipped from
  `ReadWriteMany` to `ReadWriteOnce` (per-replica claim now).
- `artifacts.filesystem.accessMode` is configurable; defaults to
  `ReadWriteOnce`. The chart fail-checks at template time when
  `server.replicas > 1` + filesystem + RWO.
- `default_image` field removed from runner profile UI form
  (column kept on the row for backwards-compat). Image is a
  job/plugin concern.

### Fixes

- Postgres dev container set `PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata`
  so `lost+found` on CSI mount points doesn't break `initdb`.
- ConfigMap that ships the runner-profiles seed now mounts via
  `subPath` so it doesn't shadow the baked plugin catalogue at
  `/etc/gocdnext/plugins`.
- Web image build context changed to repo root so `docs/*.md` ship
  with the standalone server. `/docs` page is now `force-dynamic`
  so it reads markdowns at request time, not build time.
- DTO for runner profile always emits `tags: []`, never `null`.
- Plugin go: installs `gcc + musl-dev` so cgo (`go test -race`)
  works on the alpine base.
- Scalar API explorer: hosted on its own Astro page outside
  Starlight, with light/dark logo variants and a relative spec
  URL that respects the Astro `base` prefix.
