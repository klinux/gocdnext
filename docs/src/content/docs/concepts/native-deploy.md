title: Native deploys (ArgoCD)
description: "Register a native deploy target for an environment and gocdnext becomes the executor — it drives the ArgoCD sync and watches the Application to Synced + Healthy, server-side, with no agent and no deploy script."
---

By default, [`deploy:`](/gocdnext/docs/concepts/deployments/) is a
**tracking marker**: your job runs its own `script:` / `uses:` to
ship, and gocdnext records what shipped where. A **native deploy
target** flips that for one environment — register it, and gocdnext
becomes the **executor**: it drives the ArgoCD sync and watches the
Application to `Synced + Healthy` itself, **server-side, with no agent
and no deploy `script:`**.

The two are the same `deploy:` block. Whether a job is tracking-only
or native is decided purely by **whether its environment has a
registered target** — the pipeline YAML doesn't change.

## Two behaviours of one `deploy:` job

| Environment has… | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **no** registered target | **Tracking layer** (the default). The job runs your `script:`/`uses:` on an agent; a [deployment revision](/gocdnext/docs/concepts/deployments/#environments-and-revisions) is recorded from the job's outcome. |
| a **native target** | **Native / server-managed.** No agent, no `script:` — gocdnext issues the ArgoCD sync (in `trigger` mode) and watches the Application to convergence. The job's success **is** the deploy's convergence. |

A job whose environment has no target simply falls through to the
normal agent path, so registering a target is a **non-breaking opt-in
per environment** — nothing else in the pipeline moves.

## What "native" means

gocdnext runs a **server-side deployment provider** — a thin client
over the ArgoCD API. It **observes and syncs, but never reconciles**:
ArgoCD stays the reconciler and the manifest renderer
(helm/kustomize/your GitOps repo). gocdnext does not become a second
controller — it asks ArgoCD to sync, then watches the Application's
`.status` to a verdict.

> **Scope today:** the provider implements **sync + watch** (observe an
> Application to `Synced + Healthy`, or trigger the sync first) **and
> gate-driven Argo Rollouts control** — a canary that pauses at an
> indefinite `pause: {}` step arms a gocdnext approval gate (approve →
> promote a step, reject → abort). A `git-only` write mode remains a
> future phase in

## Registering a target

Register a target from the **maintainer dialog** on the
[Environments card](#what-the-operator-sees), or via the API below. Both
paths are **maintainer-gated** — list, upsert, and delete all require the
`maintainer` role, because the target reveals which cluster / Application
/ namespace an environment deploys to. (A target that carries a
`governing_gate` tightens the gate **and** its rollout routing to
**admin** — see [gate-driven rollouts](#gate-driven-canary-rollouts).)

```bash
# Upsert the target for one environment (1:1, keyed on environment).
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOCDNEXT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://gocdnext.example.com/api/v1/projects/shop/deploy-targets \
  -d '{
    "environment": "production",
    "cluster":     "argocd-hub",
    "application": "shop-prod",
    "namespace":   "argocd",
    "sync_mode":   "trigger"
  }'
```

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `environment` | **yes** | The gocdnext environment this target deploys — the **match key** for a `deploy:` job. Must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]{0,63}$`. |
| `cluster` | **yes** | A [registered cluster](/gocdnext/docs/concepts/clusters/) name — **the cluster whose API hosts the ArgoCD Application CR** (the ArgoCD hub, see below), *not* the workload's destination cluster. |
| `application` | **yes** | The ArgoCD `Application` name. |
| `namespace` | no | Namespace holding the Application CR. Defaults to `argocd`. |
| `sync_mode` | **yes** | `trigger` or `observe` (no default). |

`provider` is always `argocd` — you don't send it.

**Validation is fail-closed and happens before any write.** Beyond the
field checks, the server **fetches the real Application** through the
cluster to confirm it: (a) exists and is reachable, (b) the project is
authorised for that cluster, and (c) is **single-source** —
multi-source Applications are rejected (`422`). A registration that
passes has already proven the whole read path works.

```bash
# List the project's targets
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOCDNEXT_TOKEN" \
  https://gocdnext.example.com/api/v1/projects/shop/deploy-targets

# Remove one (frees the environment back to tracking-only)
curl -sS -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOCDNEXT_TOKEN" \
  https://gocdnext.example.com/api/v1/projects/shop/deploy-targets/production
```

Every upsert/delete is audited (`deploy_target.set` /
`deploy_target.delete`).

## `trigger` vs `observe`

| Mode | For | What gocdnext does |
|---|---|---|
| `trigger` | **manual-sync** Applications | Issues the sync itself — patches the Application's `.operation` (as user `gocdnext`, carrying the app's own `syncPolicy.syncOptions` such as `CreateNamespace=true`) — then watches to convergence. This is the mode where a gocdnext gate can precede the sync. |
| `observe` | **auto-sync** Applications | Issues **no** sync. An external GitOps writer commits and ArgoCD auto-syncs; gocdnext only **watches** the Application to `Synced + Healthy`. |

In both modes the deploy succeeds only when the Application reports
`Synced + Healthy` **at the revision this run expects** (correlated by
the full commit SHA ArgoCD reports). If it doesn't converge within the
deadline (**15 min** default) the deploy fails with a progress-deadline
error; a `Degraded` health is debounced briefly before failing, to ride
out a transient blip.

## End-to-end examples

### Gated deploy in `trigger` mode (build → approve → native sync)

Register the target once (maintainer):

```bash
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOCDNEXT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://gocdnext.example.com/api/v1/projects/shop/deploy-targets \
  -d '{"environment":"production","cluster":"argocd-hub","application":"shop-prod","sync_mode":"trigger"}'
```

Then the pipeline — a gate, then the deploy job:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    stage: build
    image: golang:1.23
    script: ["make build"]

  promote-prod:
    stage: deploy
    approval:
      description: "Promote to production"
      approver_groups: [release-approvers]

  ship-prod:
    stage: deploy
    needs: [promote-prod]
    # The body is the FALLBACK — it runs only if `production` has NO
    # registered target. With the target above registered, gocdnext
    # syncs ArgoCD itself and this `uses:` never runs.
    uses: ghcr.io/klinux/gocdnext-plugin-argocd@v1
    with:
      command: "app sync shop-prod"
    deploy:
      environment: production
      # No `version:` → correlates against THIS run's commit
      # (CI_COMMIT_SHA) — the SHA ArgoCD reports as synced.
```

On this run: `build` runs on an agent, `promote-prod` blocks for the
approval, and once approved `ship-prod` is taken over by the server —
**no agent** — which patches the Application's `.operation` to sync
`shop-prod`, then watches it to `Synced + Healthy` at the run's commit.
The gate precedes the sync, which is exactly what `trigger` mode is for.

:::caution[The `deploy:` job always needs a body — it's your fallback]
The parser rejects a `deploy:` job with no `script:` / `uses:` /
`image:+settings:`. That body is **the fallback deploy**: with a native
target registered it never executes (the server syncs instead); remove
the target and the same job degrades to running the body on an agent.
So you can adopt — or back out of — native deploys **without touching
the pipeline**. A natural body is the [`argocd` plugin](/gocdnext/docs/reference/plugins/#argocd)
(as above) or your existing `kubectl`/`helm` step.
:::

:::caution[`version:` must be a git SHA for native deploys]
A native deploy correlates success against the **full git commit SHA
ArgoCD reports** as synced. So `version:` must be a commit SHA — or
omitted, which uses the run's own commit (`CI_COMMIT_SHA`), the common
case. An **image tag or semver** (e.g. `${{ needs.build.outputs.image-tag }}`,
fine for a [tracking-layer deploy](/gocdnext/docs/concepts/deployments/))
**fails a native deploy terminally** — it can't be tied to a commit. If
your manifests live in a separate GitOps repo at a different SHA, pin
`version:` to that commit's full/short SHA.
:::

### Watch-only in `observe` mode (auto-sync app)

For an Application that ArgoCD already **auto-syncs** (an external
GitOps writer commits the manifests), register the target as `observe`:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOCDNEXT_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://gocdnext.example.com/api/v1/projects/shop/deploy-targets \
  -d '{"environment":"staging","cluster":"argocd-hub","application":"shop-staging","sync_mode":"observe"}'
```

```yaml
jobs:
  watch-staging:
    stage: deploy
    uses: ghcr.io/klinux/gocdnext-plugin-argocd@v1   # fallback only
    with:
      command: "app wait shop-staging --health"
    deploy:
      environment: staging
```

gocdnext issues **no** sync here — it just watches `shop-staging` to
`Synced + Healthy` at the run's commit and finalizes the job on
convergence (or fails on the deadline). Use `observe` when something
else owns the sync and you only want gocdnext to gate the pipeline on
the real rollout landing.

## Centralized ArgoCD: `cluster:` is the hub, not the destination

This is the part worth being explicit about. In the target,
**`cluster:` is the cluster where ArgoCD runs** — the one whose
Kubernetes API serves the `Application` CR that gocdnext reads and
patches. It is **not** the cluster the workload lands on.

Where the workload lands is the Application's own `spec.destination`,
which is **entirely ArgoCD's concern** — gocdnext never reads or writes
it. So a **single centralized ArgoCD managing many destination
clusters is the natural fit**, and it needs no special handling:

```
                 ┌────────────────────── ArgoCD hub cluster ──────────────────────┐
  gocdnext ────► │  ns: argocd                                                     │
  (reads +       │    Application "shop-staging"  → spec.destination: cluster-a    │ ──► workload → cluster-a
   patches       │    Application "shop-prod"     → spec.destination: cluster-b    │ ──► workload → cluster-b
   the CR)       │    Application "shop-eu"       → spec.destination: cluster-eu   │ ──► workload → cluster-eu
                 └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Topology | How to register |
|---|---|
| **Centralized ArgoCD** (one hub, many destination clusters) | Register the **hub** once in the [cluster registry](/gocdnext/docs/concepts/clusters/). Every target points `cluster:` at that hub, `namespace: argocd`, and names a different `application`. |
| **ArgoCD per environment/region** (several hubs) | Register each hub as its own cluster; each target's `cluster:` points at the right hub. |

**Credentials.** The hub cluster is a normal
[cluster-registry](/gocdnext/docs/concepts/clusters/) entry —
`kubeconfig` or a scoped `token`. Because the control plane reaches the
hub *from outside*, **`in_cluster` credentials are rejected** for
native targets (they're only valid from inside that cluster's own
pods). The token needs least-privilege RBAC on the Application CRs — at
minimum `get` (to observe) and `patch` (to sync in `trigger` mode):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: argocd
  name: gocdnext-deployer
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
    resources: ["applications"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "patch", "update"]
```

**For gate-driven rollout control** (below), the token that reaches the
**Rollout's cluster** (the workload's destination — the same registered
cluster as the Application in a co-located hub, or a separate
`rollout_cluster`) additionally needs `rollouts` **and** the
`rollouts/status` subresource, in the workload namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: shop      # the Rollout's namespace, not argocd
  name: gocdnext-rollout-controller
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
    resources: ["rollouts"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "patch"]
  # Promote (clear pauseConditions) and Abort (set abort) are merge-patches
  # to the /status subresource — a distinct RBAC resource.
  - apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
    resources: ["rollouts/status"]
    verbs: ["get", "patch", "update"]
```

## Gate-driven canary rollouts

When the Application manages an [Argo
Rollouts](https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/) `Rollout`, a native
target can **observe and control** the canary. Turn on `rollout_aware`
(gocdnext reads the Rollout the Application manages — auto-discovered
from `.status.resources[]`, or pin `rollout_cluster`/`rollout_namespace`/
`rollout_name`), and add a `governing_gate` to make it **gated**:

```json
{
  "environment": "production",
  "cluster": "argocd-hub",
  "application": "shop-prod",
  "rollout_aware": true,
  "governing_gate": { "approvers": ["sre@acme"], "required": 2, "description": "prod canary" }
}
```

A `governing_gate` is **admin-only** to set or change, and — once a
target is gated — so is the rollout routing (a maintainer must not be
able to reroute around a gate they can't drop). `rollout_aware` alone,
with no gate, is **observe-only**: gocdnext surfaces canary progress but
never promotes or aborts.

The loop, once the deploy is in flight:

1. The canary advances until it reaches an **indefinite `pause: {}`**
   step (no `duration` — the human-gate step). Timed pauses, analysis
   pauses, and blue-green pauses do **not** arm a gate.
2. gocdnext **arms** a gate on the in-flight deploy, pinning the
   Rollout's identity and minting a fresh `gate_id`. The deploy job
   stays `running`; its **progress deadline is suspended** while the
   gate awaits a human.
3. The Environments card shows *Canary paused · step 3/5 · awaiting
   approval (1/2)* with **Approve** / **Reject**. Votes reuse the same
   quorum / groups / allow-list engine as pipeline
   [approval gates](/gocdnext/docs/concepts/approvals/).
4. **Approve** (once quorum is met) → gocdnext **promotes** one step
   (clears `pauseConditions`); the controller advances and re-pauses at
   the next `pause: {}`, re-arming a fresh gate. **Reject** → gocdnext
   **aborts** (sets `.status.abort`) — traffic returns to stable. Once
   the decision lands the deadline **resumes**, so a stuck controller
   still fails on the budget rather than hanging.
5. A `Synced + Healthy` Application does **not** finalize success while
   the canary is mid-rollout — only when it is **fully promoted**
   (past all steps, new version stable). Superseding or canceling the
   run **aborts** the rollout too.

Under a control-mode read error (the Rollout can't be observed), gocdnext
**fails closed**: it never promotes on uncertainty and never finalizes on
Application health alone — but a **reject still aborts** (abort is safe;
promote is not).

## What the operator sees

Targets are registered from the **maintainer dialog** on the Environments
card; observation is visible to viewers, and the rollout controls are
maintainer+/admin-gated (below):

- **Environments card** — a native row per environment: *Native ·
  ArgoCD · app `<application>` · cluster `<cluster>` · `<sync_mode>`*
  (an eye icon for `observe`, a refresh icon for `trigger`). A maintainer
  gets an **Add / edit target** dialog here (and, for an admin,
  **Remove** — a hard-delete that also drops the environment's deploy
  history, refused with a **409** while a deploy is in flight). The config
  detail is maintainer-only.
- **Rollouts dashboard** (`/projects/{slug}/rollouts`) — a live view, per
  cluster + namespace, of every canary and blue-green `Rollout`: steps
  timeline, traffic split, revision strip, and AnalysisRun. When a gate
  governs a Rollout it surfaces **Approve / Reject** on that exact
  Rollout; for a **non-gated** rollout a maintainer gets **direct Promote
  / Abort** (a gated rollout refuses direct control with a **409** — the
  decision must flow through the audited vote path, never a bypass). A
  **quick-pick** lists the project's configured rollout targets so you
  never have to guess the pair — remember the `Rollout` CR lives in the
  **workload** namespace, *not* the `argo-rollouts` **controller**
  namespace (which holds zero Rollouts).
- **Live watch chip** — while a native deploy is in flight, a chip
  shows `Deploying` → `Syncing` (once the sync is requested) →
  `Degraded <time>` if health drops. A rollout-aware deploy shows canary
  state instead (`Rolling out step 3/5`, `Canary paused`, `Rollout
  healthy`/`aborted`). When the canary is running a metric **AnalysisRun**,
  an `analysis <phase>` badge rides alongside (observe-only) — red for
  `Failed`/`Error`, amber for `Inconclusive`, green for `Successful` —
  with the analysis message on hover, so an inconclusive pause reads as
  *"analysis inconclusive: success-rate 0.91 < 0.95"*, not a bare
  "Paused". Backed by `GET /api/v1/projects/{slug}/deploy-watches`
  (viewer-readable, but config fields are maintainer-only).
- **Approval prompt** — when a canary gate is armed, an amber *Canary
  paused · awaiting approval (N/M)* banner with **Approve** / **Reject**
  appears on the card. The server enforces the approvers allow-list and
  the `gate_id` token, so a stale tab voting on a superseded step gets a
  clear 409.
- **Server logs** — the watch loop emits `watch_claimed`,
  `watch_observed`, `watch_decision`, and `watch_finalize`; the
  scheduler logs `deploy_native_selected` / `native deploy dispatched`
  when a job takes the native path (never dispatched to an agent).

## Fail-closed posture

Native deploys never fake success. An unreachable hub, an auth error, a
revision mismatch, or a non-convergent Application all **hold or fail**
— they never mark an environment healthy on incomplete evidence. A
target-resolution error (as opposed to "no target registered") stops
the dispatch and retries next tick rather than silently falling back to
an agent run.

## What this is not (yet)

- **Not a reconciler.** gocdnext asks ArgoCD to sync and watches the
  result; ArgoCD owns desired state and rendering.
- **Reject is not a Git revert.** Rejecting a gate **aborts** the
  Rollout — traffic shifts back to the stable ReplicaSet — but
  `.spec.template` (the desired version) is unchanged, so a re-sync or a
  corrected commit rolls forward. gocdnext never rewrites Git.
- **Not a replacement for the [`argocd` plugin](/gocdnext/docs/reference/plugins/#argocd).**
  The fire-and-forget plugin remains for bespoke setups; a pipeline
  opts into native `deploy:` when it wants convergence + gate coupling.
